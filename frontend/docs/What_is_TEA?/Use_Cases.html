<p>The TEA Project is versatile enough to host dApps on its own ecosystem as well as act as a layer-2 for other blockchains. Here are a few examples of how the TEA Project is being used in crypto.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a target='_blank'  href="https://teaproject.org/#/doc_list/%2FBlog_and_Vlog%2FGluon_yet_another_crypto_wallet.md">Gluon Secure Crypto Wallet</a>. The Gluon walet is built on top of the TEA project and can easily be integrated with other modern two-factor authentication solutions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a target='_blank'  href="https://teaproject.org/#/doc_list/%2FBlog_and_Vlog%2FTurn_ipfs_file_system_to_ipfs_function_service.md">Adding Computing Functions to IPFS</a>. IPFS miners can add TPM-enabled hardware to their machines and start offering services to the TEA network. IPFS miners would then be able to add &quot;function as a service&quot; to their storage services they provide on IPFS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
