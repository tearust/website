<div class="t-md"><p>The TEA Project started in 2019, and has been self funded until early 2021. </p>
<p>In Nov. 2020, the TEA Project released the AI-based image recognition demo, running in a simulator of TPM-based secure computing nodes. </p>
<p>In early 2021, our Gluon wallet application won Web3 Foundationâ€™s Open Grant. Subsequently we started to implement the TEA runtime on Amazon Nitro, which was completed in April 2021. </p>
<p>In June 2021, the TEA Project completed the seed round funding.</p>
<p>In Q3 of 2021, we plan to be ready for pre-mining of $T tokens and for issuing CML tokens. </p>
<p>In Q4 of 2021 or early 2022, we plan to have the main net ready for public mining of $T tokens. We also plan to have a TEA box ready for miners to purchase and use as mining machines.</p>
<p>In the second half of 2022, we plan to have trust-as-a-service ready to be adopted by other blockchain or non-blockchain platforms. We also plan to provide the SDK for running rich dApps on the TEA platform. </p>
<p>In 2023, we plan to launch a TEA-based decentralized token exchange. We also plan to offer additional technology options for the mining nodes.</p>
