<div class="t-md"><h1 id="tea-runs-on-top-of-blockchain">TEA Runs on Top of Blockchain</h1>
<p>TEA itself is not a blockchain, but it is built on top of blockchain technologies. TEA uses blockchain as a layer-1 to provide</p>
<ul>
<li>Economical incentive and penalty that forms the basis of its token economy.</li>
<li>Immutable trust information storage, such as credit history, key IDs and hashes.</li>
<li>Block height as a universal clock between TEA nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>As explained in <a class='js_click_md' href="../What_is_TEA?/TEA_vs_blockchain.md">TEA vs Blockchain</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TEA nodes runs above other blockchains. Any blockchain can send a computational oracle request in a blockchain event and receive the result along with PoT (proof of trust) in a tx at the later time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our milestone 1 demo, we use Substrate as our layer-1 blockchain provider. But this doesn’t mean TEA can only work with Substrate. In fact, any blockchain layer-1 with smart contract support will work with TEA, such as ETH etc. Of course, newer blockchain projects are prefered. That’s why we chose Substrate: it&#39;s written in Rust and WASM (the same tech that the TEA Project is built on), it&#39;s modern, fast and release-ready.</p>
<h1 id="tea-works-for-blockchain">TEA Works for Blockchain</h1>
<p>TEA not only utilizes blockchain, but TEA also works as a layer-2 solution for layer-1. It can offload expensive and computationally complex tasks from layer-1, run the code in a trusted environment and send the result back to the blockchain together with verifiable Proof of Trust (PoT) data. In our milestone 1 demo, we run a Tensorflow image recognization algorithm offloaded from the blockchain. Have you ever dared run Tensorflow algorithm in a smart contract? Before the TEA Project, you&#39;d have to have been crazy rich to try such a thing.</p>
